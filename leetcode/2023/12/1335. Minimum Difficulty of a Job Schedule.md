Dynamic Programming.
The point is how to group these numbers for minimize the sum of maximum number of each group.

```python
class Solution:
    def minDifficulty(self, jobDifficulty: List[int], d: int) -> int:
        if len(jobDifficulty) < d: 
            return -1
        # How to group these numbers for minimize the sum of maximum number of each group
        n = len(jobDifficulty)
        dp = [[(10 ** 7)] * (d + 1)  for _ in range(n + 1)]

        dp[0][0] = 0

        total = -1
        for current in range(1, n + 1):
            total = max(total, jobDifficulty[current - 1])
            dp[current][0] = total 
            dp[current][1] = total 
            for g in range(2, d + 1):
                maxi = -1
                for cut_point in range(current, 0, -1):
                    maxi = max(maxi, jobDifficulty[cut_point - 1])
                    dp[current][g] = min(dp[current][g], dp[cut_point - 1][g-1] + maxi)

        return dp[n][d]

```
